# Crypt Project
By using keywords, you can encrypt/decrypt any message you would like.

## Key Features
- Encode messages
- Decode messages
- Limited characters (a-z, 0-9 along with the space character)
- Nest encryptions and decryptions

## How To Use
When inputting, you must declare your purpose first (encode/decode), followed by your message in parentheses. Your message can consist of any valid character as stated above. Press enter to run the encrypting/decrypting process. The output will be the resulting message.

When entering your message, you can instead declare another decrypt/encrypt.

### Examples inputs
- decode (message)
- encode (message)
- decode (encode (message))

Note the space between the encode/decode and the open parentheses. This space is needed or an error will occur.
